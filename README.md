# Bufferbloat-Analysis-and-TCP-Network-Optimization-with-Mininet

Mininet, iPerf, Linux networking tools (tcpprobe, ping), Python, TCP congestion control (Reno)

Analyzed the bufferbloat phenomenon using Mininet by simulating custom network topologies and generating traffic with
iPerf to study the effects of router queue sizes and TCP congestion control (e.g., Reno). Monitored metrics like congestion
window, queue lengths, and RTT using tools like ‘tcpprobe‘, and derived models to quantify the impact of excessive
buffering on latency and throughput. Demonstrated network simulation, traffic generation, and congestion
management expertise with practical insights applicable to real-world networks.
